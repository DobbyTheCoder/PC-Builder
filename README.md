# PC-Builder

This is a basic Java program which will recommend you PC componenets.
You just need to select which CPU you need and it will recommend you -:
1. Motherboard
2. RAM
3. GPU(if you need one)

It will do all this with keeping in mind whether youre on a budget or not.

The project is currently incomplete. Shall be complete soon

PS-  this is my first Java project. So it might be very cluttered or i might have done a few things better.
But this is basically all i know about java till now. So please bare with me. I am learning more things in Java as i write this
and i will keep updating this project to make it more effcient and usefull.
